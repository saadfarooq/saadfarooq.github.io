The basic idea is to introduce computerscience principles, particularly those related to programming; and especiallyfunctional programming, to students in K-12 by using mathematics as a lauchpadfor their foray into computer science.</p><p>The proposal bases itself on a number of reasonable assumptions that areinfluence by discussions and things picked up here andt here . However, theabsense of citations for these is obvious at this point and will hopefully befilled in over time via references to previous (or our own) research backingthose claims.</p><p>The research evolves into two distinct research questions :</p><ul><li>Can student work to understand the complex concepts of mathematics beleveraged to cause a &#39;transfer of training effect&#39; towards computer science(and vice versa) ?</li><li>Can notation be used as a &#39;tool of thought&#39; to ease the transfer of conceptsfrom mathematics to functional programming ?</li></ul><p>I will elaborate on each of these in turn.</p><h2>Functional Math</h2><p>Functional programming derives heavily from lambda calculus; a form of calculusthat was conceived long before computers were the norm, for expressingmathematical computation. The influence of lambda calculus on functionalprogramming gives it very strong mathematical roots. However, in spite of theirobvious overlaps, neither field seems to augment the other in education.Students work their way through hard mathematical concepts and very little ofthat hard work is carried over to the programming realm [citation needed]. Thehypothesis that the study would aim to affirm is that both fields are verysimilar but it is the pedagogical treatment of the concepts that makes thetransfer difficult.</p><p>I propose a study that asks people of various age groupswhat they thought were the hardest concepts were in mathematics and compares itto the same question asked of computer science students with reference toprogramming. The intuition is that both groups will find the concept of&#39;function as data&#39; to be among the hardest concepts. In mathematics, thisconcept is exhibited by operations such as derivative, summations, transforms,etc.</p><p>The rationale here is that mathematics education does not elaborate the&#39;function as data&#39; concept explicitly and by coming up with pedagogicalstrategies to do so, we can make comp105 much less painful for future students.</p><h3>Particulars of Study</h3><p>To be decided.</p><h2>Notation as a Tool of Thought</h2><p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson>Kenneth Iverson</a>&#39;s work on theuse of mathematical notation in computer programming earned him a Turing awardand led to the development of the APL programming language. &#39;Notation as a Toolof Thought&#39; was the title of his Turing award lecture. As the title suggests, itimplies the utility of notation in the thought process. He came up with anotation called a the &#39;Iverson notation&#39; which could be used for writing andrationalizing about computer programs without being on a computer and the samenotation could be transferred to the computer and just run [citation needed].</p><p>Notation seems to form another barrier to the &#39;transfer of training&#39; frommathematics to computer programming. In computer science courses, students findit hard to translate notational rules into computer programs [citation needed]and whereas the Iverson notation gave a way to unite the two worlds, the effectof the differences in notation was never formalized in research [citationneeded]. Furthermore, the Iverson notation itself is a complex, hard tounderstand notation that was limited to using symbols that could be madeavailable at the time [citation needed, seems a weird claim].</p><p>A more intuitive notation system, coupled with the versatility of input systemstoday could help in bridging the gap between notational mathematics and computerprogramming.</p><p>The research study in this case is more an investigative study (would help if Iknew more about research methodologies). We go in with no assumptions orhypotheses and give the subjects the task of coming up with concise notationsfor particular notational scenarios (possibly inspired by the first study above)and look for patterns in the results.</p><h3>Particulars of Study</h3><p>To be decided.</p></div><hr><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>var disqus_developer = 1;
