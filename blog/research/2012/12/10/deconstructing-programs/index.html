I have been interested in the idea of having programming languages that people can use differently but at the same time have a social context to the programming by allowing differnt people to collaborate.</p><p>However, this raises an important question and problem. Differnt people prefer different language. How do we get them to collaborate on the same code base ?</p><p>For example, visual programming languages have been used for introductory programming, however I don&#39;t necessarily feel like checking someone&#39;s work in a visual language. I&#39;d like to work off a text based language.</p><p>This led into my discussion with Mark. He hinted at some work done in the 60&#39;s that proved that all programs could be deconstructed using only four constructs <strong>if , then , else</strong> and <strong>while</strong>.</p><p>This doesn&#39;t seem to be our real problem. The real problem seems to be the reconstruction. After deconstructing a programming into just these constructs what would be the best way to reconstruct them in a sane manner. That is an interesting question and one for which I do not currently have an answer.</p></div></div></div><!-- footer.html --><footer><hr><!-- <p>
